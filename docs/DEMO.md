# Demo script

**Goal:** "Oh—so the new AI doesn't restart the conversation."

## 5-second script

1. Open a ChatGPT thread with decisions and open questions.
2. Click Port AI → Port to Claude.
3. As the new tab opens: *"Watch. The new AI doesn't restart. Decisions, open questions, compressed thread. One click."*
4. When Claude responds in context: *"That's it. No copy-paste. Continue the work."*

## One-liners

- "Command-C / Command-V for intent, not text."
- "The new AI doesn't restart the conversation."
- "We carry decisions and questions, not a wall of text."

## Avoid

- "Port conversations" (sounds like copy-paste)
- "Memory," "identity graphs," "summarization" (say "compress")
