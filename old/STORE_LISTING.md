## Detailed description

**Continue work on another AI in one click.**

Copy-paste bloats. Port AI compresses and carries forward what matters.

**What we guarantee**

1. **Decision preservation** – We carry forward decisions and open questions, not just text. The new AI doesn't re-litigate what's already settled.

2. **Prompt slimming** – We compress conversations so the next AI doesn't get bloated. Lean context, not a wall of copy-paste.

3. **Model-specific continuation** – Each AI picks up where the last one left off. You stay in ChatGPT, Claude, Grok—no new app, no account linking.

4. **Native UX** – One click. Immediate continuation. Zero setup.

**How it works**
- Click Port → choose destination AI
- Extension extracts, compresses, and injects
- New AI continues the work

**Experimental / developer tool**
- DOM-based extraction; may break when sites update
- Best-effort summarization
- Manual but powerful
- For power users, builders, researchers

**Privacy**
- Data is local-only (Chrome storage)
- No third-party servers (except optional localhost Ollama)
- No analytics, no tracking

**Supported**: ChatGPT, Claude, Grok
