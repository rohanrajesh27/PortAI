# 5-second demo script

**Goal:** Make someone say "Oh—so the new AI doesn't restart the conversation."

---

## Script

1. **Open a ChatGPT thread** (or Claude, Grok) with a few back-and-forths—decisions made, questions open.

2. **Click Port AI → Port to Claude** (or whichever you're not on).

3. **As the new tab opens, say:**

   > "Watch. The new AI doesn't restart. It gets decisions, open questions, and a compressed thread. One click."

4. **When Claude (or the other AI) responds in context:**

   > "That's it. No copy-paste. No re-explaining. Continue the work."

---

## One-liners (pick one)

- "Command-C / Command-V for intent, not text."
- "The new AI doesn't restart the conversation."
- "We carry decisions and questions, not a wall of text."

---

## What to avoid

- "Port conversations" (sounds like copy-paste)
- "Memory" or "identity graphs"
- "Summarization" (say "compress" or "slim")
