## Detailed

**Continue work on another AI in one click.**

Copy-paste bloats. Port AI compresses and carries forward what matters.

1. **Decision preservation** – Carries decisions and open questions. The new AI doesn't re-litigate what's settled.
2. **Prompt slimming** – Compresses so the next AI doesn't get bloated.
3. **Model-specific continuation** – Each AI picks up where the last left off.
4. **Native UX** – One click. Zero setup.

**How it works:** Click Port → choose AI → extension extracts, compresses, injects → new AI continues.

**Experimental:** DOM-based extraction; may break when sites update. Best-effort. Manual but powerful.

**Privacy:** Local only. No third-party servers (except optional localhost Ollama).

**Supported:** ChatGPT, Claude, Grok
